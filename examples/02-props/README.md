This example shows how to parameterize a component through the use of props.

GOALS:
* Externalize properties of the HelloWorld component (that the previous example defines as hard-coded values) using React-style props.

NOTES:
* There's a new 'components' folder for holding the component module files.
* *webpack.config.js* now instructs Webpack to also search within the 'components' folder for required modules.
