This is the absolute minimal **px2react** app.

GOALS:
* Create a *index.js* file to serve as the entry point to the app.
* Create the *package.json* file common to all Node.js projects.
* Create a *webpack.config.js* file that contains the basic configuration for building the app via Webpack.

NOTES:
* The only thing that this app does is create a text object onscreen.
* You can use this example as a sanity check for your Node.js+pxScene setup.
* *package.json* lists the **px2react** package as a dependency.
